1. Background noise removal
2. Audio normalization
3. Segmentation and removal of silent chucks
4. Feature extraction: Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs): Provide a representation of the short-term power spectrum of sound.
Pitch and Prosodic Features: Capture linguistic features like intonation and rhythm.
Spectral Features: Such as Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) coefficients, which capture frequency information more readily. 
5. Model Training:
For supervised learning, datasets with labeled speaker change points are used to train the model.
The model learns to recognize patterns that correspond to changes in speakers based on the features extracted
